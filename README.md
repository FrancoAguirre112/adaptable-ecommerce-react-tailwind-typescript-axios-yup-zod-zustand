The Adaptable Ecommerce project is a web application built using React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript with Axios, Yup, Zod, React Router and Zustand wich connect to a Supabase database to get the visual configuration of the page and the products of the store. The supabase database is in turn connected to a Google Sheet's document for easier and simpler accessibility to the website data.
This project is aimed at entrepeneurs that are just starting and don't have any knowledge on how to create a website, the idea came after receiving a couple of request to build a website for family and friends who are starting a project of their own, with this project I can simply modify it a bit and give them a fully functional website to start their projects.
